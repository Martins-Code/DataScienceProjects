## Project 1: Economic Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis of economic data using the FRED API. The goal was to explore and analyze unemployment rates and labor force participation rates for different regions or states. The project involved the following steps:

- Data collection using the FRED API to pull the necessary datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the unemployment and participation rates.
- Data visualization using various plotting libraries to visualize the findings.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis.

## Project 2: COVID-19 Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis on COVID-19 data from various regions in the world to understand the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The project involved the following steps:

- Data collection from reliable sources to gather COVID-19 datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data accuracy.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify regions with the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Data visualization using interactive charts and maps to visualize the findings.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 in different regions.

_Note: The COVID-19 Analysis project provides valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic and highlights the importance of understanding and monitoring the spread of the virus._

## Project 3: Salary Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed salary data based on various factors such as age, education level, job title, and more. The project covered the following steps:

- Data loading and initial exploration to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to gain insights.
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest).
- Visualizing model performance using residual plots, feature importance plots, learning curves, and cross-validated performance plots.

## Project 4: Cancer Data Analysis

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of cancer data to predict the diagnosis using various machine learning algorithms. The project covered the following steps:

- Data loading and initial exploration to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to gain insights.
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Classifier).
- Analyzing and comparing the accuracy of each model.
- Drawing conclusions and insights from the analysis.
