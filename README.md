## Project 1: Economic Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis of economic data using the FRED API. The goal was to explore and analyze unemployment rates and labor force participation rates for different regions or states. The project involved the following steps:

- Data collection using the FRED API to pull the necessary datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the unemployment and participation rates.
- Data visualization using various plotting libraries to visualize the findings.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis.
