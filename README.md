## Project 1: Economic Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis of economic data using the FRED API. The goal was to explore and analyze unemployment rates and labor force participation rates for different regions or states. The project involved the following steps:

- Data collection using the FRED API to pull the necessary datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the unemployment and participation rates.
- Data visualization using various plotting libraries to visualize the findings.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis.

## Project 2: COVID-19 Analysis

In this project, I conducted an analysis on COVID-19 data from various regions in the world to understand the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The project involved the following steps:

- Data collection from reliable sources to gather COVID-19 datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data accuracy.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify regions with the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Data visualization using interactive charts and maps to visualize the findings.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from the analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 in different regions.
